  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

## sirmordred 1.1.3 - (2024-11-13)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Panels import bug and Micro Mordred failure\
   A bug was causing Panels to fail to import in Kibiter and preventing
   micro Mordred from working. The issue was in tasks that didn’t require
   a SortingHat client to run.


  ## sirmordred 1.1.2 - (2024-10-15)
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

## sirmordred 1.1.1 - (2024-09-23)

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Python minimum version updated\
   Python 3.8 will reach its end of life in October 2024. Python 3.9 is
   the minimum version required by the project.


## sirmordred 1.1.0 - (2024-08-30)

**Performance improvements:**

 * Reduced the number of connections to SortingHat\
   Mordred makes a lot of connections to the SortingHat server which
   could cause the uWSGI queue to fill up. When the uWSGI queue is full,
   Mordred cannot connect to the SortingHat server.


  ## sirmordred 1.0.5 - (2024-08-13)
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

## sirmordred 1.0.4 - (2024-08-09)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Identity refresh bug for some items\
   Fix issue where some fields were not refreshed. The bug occurred
   because the queries to OpenSearch filtered items in which
   `author_uuid` was the individual pk, but not when the `<role>_uuid`
   was the individual pk. That causes many items that contain the
   `<role>_uuid` but not the `author_uuid` not to be refreshed.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Days in collection spent time\

   day.

   that read the list of projects didn't have time to even start before
   the manager finalizes it, so data backends didn't have any have any
   input to work with. This bug was originally reported by ncsibra-lab49
   on

   GrimoireLab packages:

     - graal >= 0.3
     - cereslib >= 0.3
     - kidash >= 0.5
     - grimoirelab-penales >= 0.1
     - grimoire-elk >= 0.102

   Perceval dependencies are removed because they are installed
   with `grimoire-elk`.

   Add the `pair-programming` to the `_get_enrich_backend` method if it
   exists in the setup.cfg file.

**Feature removals:**

 * Drop Python 3.6 support\
   Python 3.6 reached the end of life at the end of 2021. This means it
   won't receive new updates or patches to fix security issues.
   Therefore, this package will only work with Python >= 3.7 from now on.
 * FINOS Meeting backend removed\
   FINOS Meeting backend is not supported anymore. The Perceval backend
   was archived in Bitergia repository so it shouldn't be part of the
   core anymore because it's software not maintained.

**Others:**

 * Add studies to the alias file\
   Add onion, areas of code, and demographics studies to the file
   aliases.json. This is needed to keep this file updated with the
   aliases we use in the dashboards by adding them to the appropiate data
   sources. The included aliases: - all_onion - git_areas_of_code -
   demographics
